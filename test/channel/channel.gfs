# Title: Flow through a divergent channel
#
# Description:
#
# A test case initially presented by Almgren et al \cite{almgren97}.
# The Euler equations are solved in a divergent channel for a unit
# inflow velocity on the left boundary and outflow on the right
# boundary.
#
# Tables \ref{channel-x} and \ref{channel-y} illustrate the errors and
# convergence orders obtained for both components of the velocity when
# the resolution varies. Richardson extrapolation is used.  The errors
# are computed either on the whole domain (All cells) or on the cells
# whose parents at level 5 are entirely contained in the fluid (Full
# 128 cells).
#
# Close to second-order convergence is obtained in the bulk of the
# fluid, reducing to first-order close to the boundaries. The errors
# are small in all cases (with a maximum of .5\%) and comparable to
# that obtained by Almgren et al using a different discretisation.
