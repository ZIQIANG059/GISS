# Title: Circular droplet in equilibrium
#
# Description:
#
# A circular droplet of diameter $D=0.8$ is initialised centered on
# the top-left corner of the unit box. Surface tension is imposed on
# the interface. The exact solution is given by Laplace's law: uniform
# zero velocity and a pressure jump accross the interface exactly
# balancing the surface tension force.
#
# The initial condition -- while close to the exact solution -- does
# not guarantee the exact balance between the numerical
# discretisations of surface tension and pressure gradient. However,
# these small initial perturbations generate small capillary waves
# which are progressively (on a timescale of order $D^2/\mu$) damped
# by viscosity so that the exact (to round-off error) balance is
# eventually obtained.
#
# The convergence is obtained for a wide range of Laplace numbers
# $La=\sigma\rho D/\mu^2$, as illustrated on Figure \ref{laplace}.
#
# Figure \ref{convergence} illustrates the convergence of the error on
# the droplet shape as a function of resolution for a Laplace number
# of 12000.
