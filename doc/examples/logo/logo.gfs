# Title: Coalescence of a pair of Gaussian vortices (Gerris logo)
#
# Description:
#
# This example generates the Gerris desktop logo (Figure \ref{logo}).
#
# A pair of Gaussian vortices slowly merge. This is the primary
# mechanism controlling the evolution of two-dimensional turbulence
# and consequently has been studied in some detail.
