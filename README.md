# GISS
GISS is a powerful and efficient 3D Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) flow and solid solver to simulate solid-fuild flows at unprecedented detail and accuracy.


This solver has been developed by Erich Essmann (IMT, University of Edinburgh),Pei Shui (IMT, University of Edinburgh), Prashant Valluri (IMT, University of Edinburgh), Rama Govindarajan (ICTS, TIRF) and  ..... This project would not have been possible without finincal support from Thermosmart

The flow subsolver is based on Gerris which has been developed by St√©phane Popinet. 


Features
========
* Highly accurate DNS solver using Gerris 
* Open Dynamics Engine used for solid modelling
* Immerised Boundary Method for complex solid geometries
* High Particle Reynolds numbers
* Solid/Fluid density ratios
* Fluid mixing caused by solid motion
